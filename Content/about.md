# About UWG

UWG aims to be a resource for writers of all levels of skill and experience. It focuses on the world of writing _before_ publication, from brainstorming and productivity to writing, editing and everything that comes after.

The Unpublished Writer's Guide to Writing for No One is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and published in Swift via John Sundell's open-source [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) static site generator.

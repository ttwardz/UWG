I mean <em>do</em>: what would you work on, what would you learn, what would you create?</p><p>What would you spend forty hours a week doing if that time was [completely] for yourself, not for money or responsibility or social necessity?</p><p>Would it be the thing you currently do as your job? My guess is… probably not.</p><h2>What It Means to Do Whatever You Want</h2><p>Remove yourself from the context of "career" or "employment” or "job".</p><p>I want you to consider everything you like to do and decide whether each one of those things is your dream or just a hobby, your passion or merely an interest.</p><p>This question, <em>what's your passion</em>, is a tricky one to answer. It forces you to think far outside of the box of precedence and expectations and far outside of your current life.</p><h2>Loving Your Job Makes You Exceptional</h2><p>Every day, thousands of people make money by podcasting, playing videogames, writing blog posts, photo-journaling on social media, inventing dances, opening food trucks, reviewing products… insert one of your hobbies and someone's probably making a living [on it].</p><p>These aren’t multi-millionaire YouTubers and internet <em>influencers</em>; these are creative, hard-working people who have built audiences large enough to support them. They're not mega-stars but they've struck gold. They're earning income doing the things they love--many of which simply didn't make money (or, in some cases, didn't even exist) ten or twenty years ago.</p><p>There are thousands of these people. <strong>Yet, they are <em>exceptions</em></strong>.</p><p>How do these people become exceptions? They work extremely hard and dedicate themselves to the thing they want to do.</p><p>It's important to remember that the work is never easy; but the <em>hunger</em> to do the work comes easy to someone who's doing what they [truly] want.</p><p>How can you become an exception?</p><p>First, <strong>you need to discover your very specific passion</strong>, the thing that you'd prefer to do over anything else. You have to locate the [vein] of gold before you can start to mine it.</p><h2>Everyone is Almost Famous</h2><p>Cynics like to say, "Anybody can become famous these days."</p><p>That's oversimplified and inaccurate.</p><p>It's true that we’re living in amazing times, where almost anyone can break into almost any field with almost no formal training. Want to learn how to build furniture? Follow a few dozen YouTube tutorials and a few lists of book recommendations. Want to make short films? You can start with a phone and YouTube. Want to write a book? Publish it on Wordpress. Tweet it. Build a website for it[^Link to The Martian? or a story about its self-publication], for free, in a few minutes.</p><p>Getting started is the easy part and it’s becoming easier. As the [bar of entry drops lower, however, competition increases.</p><p>It’s harder to stand out when a hundred million people are publishing videos and blog posts every month, when ten thousand short stories are fighting for a tiny amount of attention on a web platform.</p><p>The internet gives any person with a connection access to information, tools, platforms and a <em>potential</em> audience of billions.</p><p>However, it in no way makes it easy to become "famous".</p><p><strong>The world of huge opportunities has always been open to more people than took advantage of it.</strong></p><p>It's hard work being successful. Maybe more people than ever <em>do</em> get their fifteen minutes of fame but how many of them sustain it?</p><p>It takes dedication. More than that, it takes clarity--identifying your passion and using the natural drive that comes with a passion for something to make it successful.</p><p>So what do you want to do? What would you do for 8+ hours a day if you… could?</p><p>That’s your passion.</p><h2>How to Find Your Passion</h2><p>How do you find your passion[^Find Your Grail on YouTube]?</p><p>It's a quest for truth. Dig down through the layers of assumptions, fears and social and societal roadblocks and find the <em>thing</em> that occupies your mind whenever you’re not stressing about everything else. What do you daydream about while you’re [supposed to be] prepping for a meeting or answering emails or replacing spark plugs or serving coffee?</p><p>What’s the thing you crave first after a day at the office or in the field? Videogames? Reading? Writing? Playing guitar?</p><p>What makes you <em>want</em> to hustle, even after a long day? Do you slurp down leftover pasta while working through chapters of an online course in iOS development? Do you share photos of every neighborhood you visit and every trip you take? Do you spend most of your evening on dinner, prepping, cooking and plating with such a love for the craft that two hours flies by before you realize you still haven’t <em>eaten</em> any food?</p><p>Try to catch yourself the next time you're doing it, whatever it is, and realize: <strong>you've found your passion</strong>.</p><h2>What to Do With Your Passion</h2><p>How can you turn your passion, the thing that drives you, into the thing that sustains you?</p><p>You make it work. You make it into work.</p><p>You discover—or, better yet, <em>invent</em>—a way to monetize it. You practice. Learn. Build a portfolio. Make connections. Gain experience. Volunteer. Barter.</p><p>Then, you start charging people for your skill. You work extremely hard to <em>make</em> it successful. You dedicate yourself to building a business around it so that it can grow, [sustain] itself and, eventually, fund the lifestyle you want.</p><p><strong>Find your career passion. Then make your passion your career.</strong></p><p>Make a plan to make money from the thing you love because the drive to do it is already there and the drive to do it <em>better</em> almost certainly is, too. That drive to do better is the most important thing for a self-starting entrepreneur because it’s what will keep you up at night, thinking of ways to improve your performance so that you’re better than you were the day before and, eventually, better than the competition.</p><p>Ultimately, it’s your unquenchable love for the thing that will drive you to be better than anyone else, that will help you avoid burnout, and boredom, and that paralyzing fear of failure that sits at the beginning of every new endeavor like a [bridge troll].</p><p>When you turn your passion into your career you [learn to] love your job. It's your dream job. It's no longer a job. It's the fulfillment of the cliche: <em>you'll never work a day in your life</em>.</p><p>[The point is,] the opportunity is there for you to do the thing you most want to do and make money from it. So do it! Stop wasting time daydreaming about it at work or wishing you had another hour to do it. It's more than possible; it's realistic.</p><p>The opportunity is there to love your job, to have the happiest work life by doing the thing that makes you happy. Use your passion to make that passion successful.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="label">The Latest</div><ul class="recent-item-list"><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/test">test</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/process">process</a></li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/why-write-for-no-one">Why Write for No One?</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/how-to-stop-hesitating-start-something-new">How to Stop Hesitating and Jump Into Something New</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></li></ul></div><footer><p>Copyright &#169; 2020 Tom Twardzik</p><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></div></body></html>

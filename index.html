This can lead to all kinds of difficulty when it comes to focus[^link → future article] but it can also [cause you to miss out on opportunities]. When is the <em>right time</em> to finally get started on that project you’ve been dreaming about?</p><p>Maybe you’ve been saving dozens of URLs and videos to your inspiration[^link → future] database or your read-it-later list. Maybe you’ve been fiddling with notes, sketches, mockups, models or brainstorming techniques[^link → future] and, every time you add something new, you think, next week I’ll finally <em>start</em>.</p><p>At some point, you have to conquer your fear, turn on your <strong>focus engine</strong> and begin.</p><p>When is that point? And how can you stop hesitating before you miss your opportunity?</p><h2>Personal story</h2><p>This was (one of) my problem(s):</p><p>Picture me at my desk, putting the finishing touches on some blog content for a client, sending it away in an email and relishing the blank space of time left in the day to work on <em>my</em> big projects (because there are always several, despite my best efforts). I’d look forward to my goals, my creations, my ambitions.</p><p>I’d eat something, take a deep breath, and… feel stuck.</p><p>What to do? What to prioritize? I know I started <em>that</em> yesterday, but I really want to work on <em>this</em> today. I only have—let’s see—three and a half hours before the evening, dinner and [family] time. I probably couldn’t even get <em>this</em> done in that amount of time, so I’ll save it for “tomorrow” (read: “sometime in the future”) and I’ll work on <em>this</em> instead. I guess… Ugh.</p><h2>Self-Discipline</h2><p>Gross. I know. It’s <em>your</em> ambition—let it run wild!</p><p>We writers tend to be enormous dreamers. Thinking, imagining, living within the fiction we create. But to accomplish your goal and to make your passion into a successful operation[^link: /articles/how-to-find-passion-work-happier], you have to say no to yourself. You have to set limits, [show restraint] and do the work.</p><h2>When am I ready to jump into something new?</h2><p>The feeling that comes with saying "<a href="link-SpongeBob">I'm ready</a>" to a new project is the same that comes with saying "I'm done" to a finished work. Neither is easy, or clear, or definite. The writer is never finished if left without a deadline.</p><p>Like knowing when you've finished, knowing when to start is about paying attention to your feelings. Notice when you procrastinate and equally when you think, <em>Maybe I've planned enough.</em> Listen to yourself and realize that there's never going to be the "correct" time to jump in. It might seem scary to start something possibly with too little planning. But much worse is never starting at all because the fear of being caught unprepared won't let you.</p><p>There's risk in every worthwhile endeavor.</p><h2>How to Conquer fear and jump into something new</h2><p>Starting. Is. Scary.</p><p><em>It might not work</em>, you're thinking. <em>And I'll have wasted hours and days and weeks of time on a thing that failed.</em></p><p>That right there is a recipe for failure. And <em>that</em>, right after it, is a cliche but it's also true. Nothing is guaranteed to work. And hard work doesn't guarantee success. But letting yourself be overwhelmed by the fear of failure all but guarantees a hard time.</p><p>This isn't a pep talk about believing in yourself and being courageous in the face of a plainly bad idea. It's about having confidence in the idea that you obviously think has merit, or you wouldn't have spent the last six weeks or months or years wavering about starting it.</p><p>You have more ideas in a day than you probably realize because most of them are so bad they simply float right away and disintegrate. But a few stick and they're the ones to pay attention to. And if you've got a few coming back day after day, then it's time to dig in and decided which one is the <em>really</em> good one, which one leads to the vein of gold.</p><p><a href="/articles/how-to-find-your-passion/">Which one are you passionate about?</a></p><p>I kept coming back to the idea for this website, day after day, as I wrote fiction and dreamed about publication and wrote marketing copy and client blog posts and just kept thinking about all the kinds of writing and all the possibilities for "publication" that exist and that I wasn't considering.</p><p>And I thought it was a message that I wasn't hearing enough: publication could be subjective, could be the achievement of one's goal, whatever that was. You can define what publication means for your writing. And I think clearly defining that helps shorten the journey from here to there. To the unpublished writer, publication seems like it's miles of winding unpaved paths away. But that's the capitalized, idealistic "Publication." The real publication is your own definition and that specificity makes it much closer because the steps to get there are so much clearer.</p><p>For me, it was simply to earn a living with my writing, but that means <em>my</em> writing--not a client's assignments or an editor's pitches. Whether it's fiction or this website or guest writing somewhere else, I wanted to turn my passion for writing into a sustainable business.</p></div></article></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="label">The Latest</div><ul class="recent-item-list"><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/how-to-stop-hesitating-start-something-new">How to Stop Hesitating and Jump Into Something New</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/why-write-for-no-one">Why Write for No One?</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1><a href="/articles/giant-venn-diagram">The Giant Venn Diagram and Finding Your Niche</a></h1><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/philosophy">philosophy</a></li></ul></article></li></ul></div><footer><p>Copyright &#169; 2020 Tom Twardzik</p><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
